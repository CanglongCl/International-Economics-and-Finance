## Introduction: The European Union

- The EU is an economic union of 28 nations.
  - More than 500 million citizens.
  - Over \$16,200 billion in GDP.
- Founded in 1957 as an FTA called the **European Economic Community (EEC).**
  - By late 1960s, had become a customs union and in the 1970s was renamed the **European Community (EC)**.
  - In 1992, the EC became a common market, as a result of the **Single European Act.**
  - At the same time, the **Treaty of European Union **changed the name to the European Union and began the process of forming an economic union with a common currency.

| **Total** | 507.4 | 16,220 | 37,852 |

- The EU market is comparable to the NAFTA region.
  - 507 million versus 484 million in population.
  - \$16,220 billion versus \$20,644 in GDP;
    - But as the value of the euro changes, the dollar value of its GDP does also.
- There are three groups of countries in Table 14.1:
  - Original 6 founding members;
  - Most of the rest of Western Europe;
  - Central Europe.
- In 2016 Great Britain voted to leave the EU.  If it does, it will not occur before sometime in 2019.

## The EU and its Predecessors

- In 1957, the six founding members signed the **Treaty of Rome, **creating a FTA and the EEC.
  - Developed out of the **European Coal and Steel Community **(1951) which had created free trade in coal and steel.
  - In 1955, talks were launched to form an FTA and to discuss collaboration on nuclear power for peaceful purposes.
    - These talks led to the EEC and to the **European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom).**
- A central topic for debate and negotiation was the terms of their political affiliation.
  - Centralization versus autonomy:  **subsidiarity.**
  - Institutional structure.

- Subsidiarity principle leaves to individual nations the policies that do not have a strong international dimension and centralizes those that do:
  - EU policies:  Trade, competition, environment, regional development, research and technology development, economic and monetary union;
  - National policies: Labor standards, health care, social safety nets.
- The division is not perfect and is a source of controversy.

- The ==institutional structure== is designed around three main institutions, although there are others of importance:
  - The **European Commission**`欧盟委员会`, the primary executive body.
  - The **European Council of Ministers**, the most influential legislative body.
    - Participants vary by topic:  When labor issues are under discussion, labor ministers meet;  when it is financial matters, ministers of finance, etc.
  - The **European Parliament**, the largest legislative body, and growing in influence.
    - Members are directly elected by citizens and sit with members from other countries that are in the same political party.

|  Blank | Total Votes | Minimum | Maximum |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| European Commission | 28 | 1 | 1 |
| Council of the European Union | 352 | 3 | 29 |
| European Parliament | 751 | 6 | 96 |

The Commission is one country-one vote;  other institutions have votes proportional to population.

Council votes require a **qualified majority** of 55% of countries representing at least 65% of the population.

The Parliament and the Council jointly pass laws although the Council acts independently of Parliament in some areas.

- The EU budget in 2014 was approximately \$156 billion (£142.6 billion).
  - Equals less than 1 percent of EU GDP;
  - Compare to national governments that spend 30 to 50 percent of GDP.
- Revenue is derived from three main sources:
  - A payment from each country (the largest source of revenue);
  - Tariffs on goods entering the EU;
  - An EU share of national value added taxes.
- Expenditures are primarily directed to two main areas:
  - Agricultural support and rural development, about 43 percent;
  - **Cohesion funds **to support economic development, about 50 percent of the budget.

### Deepening and Widening in the 1970s and 1980s

- Deepening:  Increasing the degree of integration.
  - Moving from an FTA to a customs union to a common market to an economic union.
  - Includes exchange rate coordination before the single currency was adopted.
- Widening: Adding new members.
  - Growing from 6 members to 28 in separate waves.
  - Political events, such as the collapse of the Soviet Union and the fall of the Berlin Wall played essential roles.

- In 1979, EC members linked their currencies.
  - Exchange rates were fixed to each other in the **European Monetary System** **(EMS).**
  - The EMS created the **exchange rate mechanism (ERM).**
    - At the center of the EMS was the **European currency unit (ECU)**:  a weighted average of the value of the member’s currencies.
    - Each member fixed their currency to the ECU; they could let it float up or down, but only within a few percentage points before they had to intervene to pull it back.
- The purpose was to prevent **competitive devaluations.**

- The EMS worked relatively well until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989**.**
- West Germany quickly decided to re-unify.
  - By 1991, it was spending large sums to repair and upgrade infrastructure and raise productivity in the eastern part of the country.
  - German bonds were in high demand, so investors needed German marks:  the demand for the mark rose.
- The challenge for other countries was to stay within the EMS band when their currencies were demanded less.
  - Choices:  raise interest rates and hurt the economy, or fail to raise rates and hurt the EMS.
  - This is the frequent dilemma of pegged (fixed) exchange rates:  focus on the internal economy or the external?

- The EMS crisis of 1992 was resolved in different ways by different countries:
  - France raised its interest rates and went into recession;
  - Italy and the UK abandoned the EMS and returned to floating exchange rates;
  - Spain devalued but stayed in the EMS.
- In response to the crisis, the allowable bandwidth for currency fluctuations was changed from ±2.25 percent to ±15 percent.

## The Single European Act

- Before the EMS crisis, economic growth rates in the EC were relatively low and the community seemed stagnant.
- In 1987, leaders adopted the **Delors Report**`德洛尔报告` in an attempt to reinvigorate the EC.
  - The Single European Act`法案`, or the **Single Market Program (SMP) **included 279 steps towards the creation of a common market.
  - The ‘**four freedoms**” were the basis of the SMP:  Freedom of movement for ==goods== and ==services== (outputs) and ==capital== and ==labor== (inputs).
- By 1992, the 279 steps had been achieved; the steps fell into three separate areas:
  - Elimination of physical barriers (borders);
  - Elimination of technical barriers (harmonization of standards);
  - Elimination of fiscal barriers (harmonization of taxes, subsidies, public procurement).

- Economic gains from the SMP were expected to come from two main sources:
  - Increased competition;
  - Economies of scale.
- The results would be achieved through:
  - More trade, lower prices, increased firm concentration.
  - These effects were observed and GDP rose 1-1.5 percent over what it would have been.
- In addition, there was a strong convergence in income levels.

**Implementation of the SEA was not without problems:**

- Restructuring of firms and industries caused some ==less efficient firms to close==;  this happened throughout the manufacturing sector, in particular.
  - Some industries, e.g., automobiles, fought this and obtained a separate set of tax laws to discourage cross-border shopping.
- Harmonization of ==technical standards== included more than 10,000 cases, some of which were ==culturally sensitive==:
  - Food product standards such as German beer, Italian pasta, rosé wine, English sausages, etc.;
  - Businesses wanted their existing standards to become the official standard;
  - Ultimately settled for mutual recognition as well as harmonization.
- ==Value added taxes== were impossible to harmonize.
  - These are a major source of revenue in most countries and their levels vary significantly;
  - Ultimately agreed to a range with a minimum of 15 percent and a maximum of 25 percent.
- Rules for ==public procurement==`采购` were also impossible to harmonize:
  - Problems of government versus private firms in different countries, historical degree of regulation of private firms;
  - Particularly an issue in telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, rail transportation and equipment, or other areas considered critical to national prosperity.

## Case Study: The Schengen Agreement

- Eliminates passport controls as part of the move to a common market and the four freedoms.
  - Originally outside EU law, but incorporated into the EU laws in 1999.
  - Includes non-EU members such as Norway, Switzerland, Iceland.
- Ireland and the UK have not accepted the agreement;
- Tensions have arisen with the entrance of Central European countries such as Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, etc.
- Tensions are further heightened by the refugee crisis in the Middle East.
  - Once a person gains admission to an Schengen country, they can move relatively freely around the EU.
  - This has created a political crisis in the EU.

## The Maastricht Treaty `马斯特里赫特条约`

- The Treaty on European Union was negotiated in 1991 in the Dutch town of Maastricht, hence it is often called the **Maastricht Treaty.**
  - Officially creates an economic union;
  - Establishes a common currency, the euro, under the monetary authority of the newly created **European Central Bank (ECB)**.
  - Accomplishes a number of other lesser goals in the areas of tax laws, health and safety, etc.
- At the time, there were 12 members of the EC, not the current 28.

- The euro`欧元` was introduced in stages:
  - First stage:  Lift restrictions on the movement of financial capital within the EU (1990).
  - Second stage:  Creation of the European Monetary Institute, which would eventually become the ECB.
  - Third stage:  Phased introduction of the euro beginning in 1999.
- The stages were intended to give countries time to prepare and to meet the **convergence criteria:**
  - A set of monetary and fiscal targets.
  - Goal:  Ensure that each member’s policies are balanced and under control.

| Goals | Targets |
| :-- | :-- |
| 1.	Stabilize exchange rates | Maintain currency within the ERM band |
| 2.	Control inflation | Reduce it to less than 1.5 percent above the average of the three lowest rates |
| 3.	Harmonize long-term interest rates | Bring to within 2 percent of the average of the three lowest rates |
| 4.	Reduce government deficits | Make less than 3 percent of national GDP |
| 5.	Reduce government debt | Make less than 60 percent of national GDP |

- The convergence criteria were intended to reduce macroeconomic imbalances that might harm the euro or the joining countries.
- The criteria are controversial because:
  - It is not clear why these targets were selected;
  - Almost no countries consistently met the targets;
  - If they can meet the targets, then they can do the same thing the euro does without having to give up their monetary policy.

Benefit and cost of single currency

- Benefits of the single currency:
  - Reduced ==cost of currency conversion`兑换`==:  perhaps 0.4 percent of GDP saved.
  - Reduce ==exchange rate uncertainty==, causing more trade and investment.
    - Not much evidence here, since traders and investors can use forward markets to hedge against currency fluctuations.
- Costs of the single currency:
  - Loss of monetary policy.
  - Cannot use flexible exchange rate as buffer against external shocks.

Reason for the euro is perhaps mostly political.
- After the lifting of capital controls in 1990 under the SMP, speculation against individual country currencies became possible and played a central role in the 1992 EMS crisis.
- This led to political frictions as countries that devalued gained new businesses at the expense of other members.
- In addition, some feared that German reunification would cause Germany to “look east;”  the euro was a way to keep Germany focused on the west.

## Case Study:  The Financial Crisis of 2007-2008

- The banking and financial crisis that began in the U.S. spread to Europe where many banks and other financial firms had purchased U.S. assets that suddenly lost value.
- In the EU, the banking crisis was severe;
  - It also turned into a deep recession;
    - The recession depressed tax revenue and required more government spending on social programs;
    - In addition, government were called on to bailout the banks that held assets that had fallen in value;
  - As government revenue fell and expenditures increased, the banking crisis became a debt crisis in several countries.

- Large deficits in several countries rapidly increased debt levels to unsustainable levels.
  - Countries were expected to cut their deficits and reduce their debts.
  - The European Central Bank was created with a “no-bailout clause” which prohibits it from acting as a lender of last resort to indebted governments.
- Countries lack an independent monetary policy and their own exchange rate; they were forced to use contractionary fiscal policies to try to balance their budgets.
  - Recessions intensified.
  - Countries with large deficits and debts were expected to cut prices and wages:  This is equivalent to a depreciation in the real exchange rate and is called internal devaluation.

- Fears that some countries would be forced out of the euro led to rapidly rising interest rates for countries with large debts.
  - In 2012, the ECB publicly announced that it would do “whatever it takes” to support the euro;
  - This calmed the markets, interest rates fell, and debts became sustainable, at least for the time being.
- The debate continues:
  - Should indebted countries restore growth first, even if it means fiscal stimulus?  Where would they get the money if markets will not lend?
  - Or, should they reduce the debt first, even if it means more stagnation and recession? If GDP falls more, will debt become less sustainable even if it is falling?
  - This debate is often framed in terms of growth versus austerity.

- The crisis in the EU was worse than in the U.S. partly because the former is not a fiscal union and the latter is.
  - The U.S. government transfers resources from states doing well to states not doing well.
    - This happens via social security, unemployment insurance, government contracts, Federal Deposit Insurance, highway spending, and other expenditures.
  - The EU has no similar mechanism.
    - If the Greek government is bankrupt, then Greek retirees may not get their pensions; unemployed Greeks will not have income supports, there is no EU-wide bank deposit insurance, etc.
- The formation of a fiscal union in the EU is controversial and unresolved.

## Widening the EU

- The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 opened the door to new members.
  - Since 2004, 13 more countries joined.
- Membership requirements:
  - Stable democracies;
  - Market based economies;
  - Formal adoption and implementation of the common body of laws, called the *acquis communautaire**.*

- Issues for the EU:
  - The **Common Agricultural Program (CAP) **is an expensive set of subsidies and many new members, e.g., Poland, have large agricultural sectors.
    - This would be a major issue if Turkey were to join.
  - Governance institutions are not designed for 28 members:  Decisions are harder to make and the process is more cumbersome.
  - Newer members are not as well off and the income gap between new and old members is growing.
    - Income gaps are associated with differences in the security of property rights, rule of law, government efficiency, and other core institutions.

## Demographic Challenges

- Europe is aging relatively quickly.
  - Population 65+ is projected to grow from 19 percent of the population in 2015 to 28 percent in 2050.
  - This raises costs of social programs, including health care, pensions, long-term care.
  - Some increased spending will be offset by decreases in education spending, unemployment benefits.
- Migration is a partial solution but encounters several obstacles:
  - Cultural resistance to immigrants.
  - Even large scale immigration would not offset the decrease in the working age population.

|   | Population, 2015 (Millions) | Percent, 2015 | Population, 2050 (Millions) | Percent, 2050 |
| :-- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Total | 513.9* | 100.0 | 507.2 | 100.0 |
| **By age category** |   |   |   |   |
| Ages 0–15 |  79.6 | 15.5 |  72.6 | 14.3 |
| Ages 15–64 | 337.9 | 65.8 | 291.5 | 57.5 |
| Ages 65+ |  96.5 | 18.8 | 143.1 | 28.2 |

Population stops growing around 2029-2030;

The working age population will fall by 46 million;

The retired population (65+) will increase by a similar amount—46 million;

Immigration of 46 million working people (about 9% of the total population in 2050) would make up the lost workers, but there would still be far more retirees.
