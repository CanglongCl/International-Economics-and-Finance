# Chapter 16 Export Oriented Growth in East Asia

## Learning Objectives

*16.1*  List four general characteristics of success in the export-oriented East Asian economies.

*16.2*  Describe how the institutional environment supported economic growth.

*16.3*  Analyze the degree of openness in the export-oriented East Asian economies.

*16.4*  Explain the pros and cons of the idea that industrial policies mattered to East Asian success.

*16.5*  Evaluate the impact of export promotion policies and the debate over their applicability to other world regions.

*16.6*  Define total factor productivity and explain why economists use it to understand whether growth in East Asia is similar to growth elsewhere.

## High-growth Asian Economies

- After World War II, Japan was the first high-growth economy in Asia.
- But it was quickly followed by two more waves of high growth:
  - Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, and Singapore;
  - Malaysia, Thailand, and later, Vietnam.
  - (China and India are discussed in chapter 17.)
- Common characteristics of these countries’ growth success:
  - Macroeconomic stability;
  - Relatively less inequality and investment in people;
  - Export promotion.

## General Characteristics of Growth

### Shared growth

- In several countries, growth was accompanied by falling inequality.
- The reasons varied from country to country but there were some commonalities:
  - Land reforms;
  - Free public education through high school;
  - Free basic health care;
  - Investments in rural infrastructure.

### Rapid accumulation of human and physical capital.

- Very high savings rates;
  - Facilitated by a rapid **demographic transition.**
  - Also helped by a stable macroeconomic environment and rapid income growth.
- High savings stimulates income growth, which feedbacks and stimulates savings:  A virtuous cycle.
- Public education dollars were invested mostly in primary and secondary education.

### Rapid growth of manufactured exports.

- All 8 countries promoted exports.
  - Export financing credits was widely available;
  - Many countries used export targets as criteria for favorable credit terms or tax breaks;
  - Tariff free access to imports of capital goods was common;
  - Some countries relied more on attracting FDI into the manufacturing sector.
- Was helped by the creation of a literate labor force with high school education.

|   | Share of the world’s merchandise exports | Share of the world’s GDP |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Hong Kong | 2.8 | 0.4 |
| Japan | 3.6 | 5.9 |
| Korea | 3 | 1.8 |
| Malaysia | 1.2 | 0.4 |
| Singapore | 2.2 | 0.4 |
| Taiwan | 1.6 | 0.7 |
| Thailand | 1.2 | 0.5 |
| Vietnam | 0.8 | 0.2 |

### Stable macroeconomic environments.

- Budget deficits and government debt were not small but they were manageable;
- Commitments to low inflation.
- Avoiding real appreciation of the exchange rate;
- The exception to macroeconomic stability was the Asian Crisis of 1997-1998.

## The Institutional Environment

- Countries generally have strong institutions in support of economic growth.
  - Secure property rights;
  - Contracts are enforced;
  - Regulations are clear and well-publicized;
  - Bureaucracies are relatively competent and efficient.
- Strong institutions does not imply democratic institutions.
  - Countries vary in terms of individual freedoms, civil liberties, and political rights.

- ==Strong fiscal discipline==;
- Institutions for ==strengthening business-government relations==:
  - **Deliberation councils** help coordinate investment decisions.
- ==Discouragement of rent seeking== by individual interests.
  - Deliberation councils helped avoid rent seeking by providing a forum for discussion;
  - Widespread use of performance requirements in return for government assistance;
  - Commitment to shared growth indicated that everyone would benefit.

### Case Study:  Institutional Quality

- The Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) measure the quality of governance institutions in six dimensions:
  - Rule of law:  The confidence of individuals and businesses in the fairness and impartiality of the law, police, and the courts.
  - Control of corruption:  The ability of governments to prevent the use of state power for individual gain.
  - Voice and accountability:  The ability of citizens to participate in government and to express themselves freely.
  - Government effectiveness:  A measure of the quality of public services and the civil service.
  - Political stability and the absence of violence/terrorism:  A measure of the absence of political instability, violence, and terrorism.
  - Regulatory quality:  A measure of government’s ability to implement effective and necessary regulations.

- Another indicator of institutional quality is the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business index.
  - Measures how easy or difficult it is to operate a business.
  - Ten dimensions, multiple indicators for each dimension.
    - Start a business, obtain permits, pay taxes, import necessary items, hire workers, enforce contracts, other essential steps.
  - Nations are ranked, from 1 to 190.

## The Role of Industrial Policies

- The World Bank concluded that governments in the high growth Asian economies were active in three areas:
  - Targeting of specific industries for promotion;
  - Directing credit to those industries;
  - Export promotion.
- The efficacy of these policies is debated;  different analysts have different opinions:
  - Highly effective in promoting growth.
  - Wasted resources, growth occurred for other reasons;
  - Ineffective:  Perhaps some effect but not the main story.

- Each of the high growth economies targeted specific industries, except Hong Kong.
  - Japan targeted steel, autos, textiles, shipbuilding, aluminum, electronics, semiconductors, others;
  - Korean policies were intense in the 1970s in petrochemical industries, steel, shipbuilding, others;
  - Taiwan was less focused, but targeted science parks, research institutes, infrastructure for import substitutes;
  - Malaysian policies took off in early 1980s, followed Japan and Korean strategies;
  - Thailand promoted industries with the potential for “technological learning”;
  - Singapore promoted technology transfer through foreign direct investment;
  - Vietnam promotes FDI for technology and the development of large conglomerates in targeted sectors.

- Countries used various tools:
  - Trade policies in the form of selective protection;
  - Directed credit provided capital but also a signal of government intentions.
  - Subsidies;
  - Market information;
  - Infrastructure development.
- Two essential elements of these policies:
  - Performance requirements;
  - Macroeconomic stability took precedence over industrial supports.

- Did industrial policies work?
  - Were they key to the high growth rates?
  - Would growth have occurred anyway?
  - Can these policies be copied elsewhere?
- Two schools of thought:
  - Mostly no effect.
    - Perhaps some industries benefitted, but targeted industries were ones that market forces would have favored anyway.
  - Were highly successful despite some failures.
    - Growth rates would have been lower in targeted industries without the support policies.

- The debate continues:
  - It is difficult to measure what would have happened without the policies;
  - Everyone agrees that other factors (those discussed in this chapter) were important as well, but the marginal effect of industrial policies are uncertain.
- If countries adopt industrial targeting policies, a few lessons stand out:
  - Performance criteria are a must;
  - Monitoring and enforcing of criteria are necessary;
  - The overall costs should not be too high, should not penalize other, non-targeted, industries.

## Case Study:  Were East Asian economies open to trade?

Tariff rates and quotas are not sufficient to answer this question since non-tariff measures may have limited imports.

The question is whether the high growth Asian economies followed mercantilist policies that severely limited imports while promoting exports, or if they were relatively market oriented in their trade.

The data show that East Asian economies were relatively open to imports, although they clearly targeted some industries for protection.

|  Blank | Imports<br />1980 | Imports<br />2014 | Exports<br />1980 | Exports<br />2014 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Hong Kong | 89.4 | 219.6 | 88.9 | 219.6 |
| Japan | 14.5 | 20.8 | 13.6 | 17.7 |
| Korea | 40.0 | 45.3 | 32.1 | 50.6 |
| Malaysia | 54.3 | 64.6 | 56.7 | 73.8 |
| Singapore | 209.0 | 163.2 | 202.1 | 187.6 |
| Taiwan | 52.6 | 60.4 | 24.1 | 70.1 |
| Thailand | 30.4 | 62.6 | 51.4 | 69.2 |
| Vietnam |  Blank  | 83.1 |   Blank | 86.4 |

High growth Asian economies were relatively open to imports, although some industries were protected.

|  Blank | Imports<br />1980 | Imports<br />2014 | Exports<br />1980 | Exports<br />2014 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  Argentina | 6.5 | 14.5 | 5.1 | 14.8 |
|  Brazil | 11.3 | 13.9 | 9.0 | 11.2 |
|  Colombia | 15.6 | 21.4 | 16.2 | 16.0 |
|  Mexico | 13.0 | 33.5 | 10.7 | 32.4 |
|  Peru | 19.4 | 23.9 | 22.4 | 22.4 |
|  Venezuela | 21.8 | 29.5 | 28.8 | 24.7 |

High growth Asian economies were relatively open to imports, particularly when compared to Latin America.

## The Role of Manufactured Exports

- All countries except Hong Kong experienced a high growth rate in the export of manufactured goods.
  - Hong Kong’s strategy was to serve as a link between the world economy and East Asia, and especially China as it began to grow.
- Exports of manufactured goods seem to be correlated with high growth rates.
  - What are the links from production of manufactured goods for export and overall economic growth?

- Potential growth effects of producing manufactured goods for export:
  - Economies of scale:  Production is for a world market rather than a domestic one;
  - Competitive effects of selling in foreign markets;
  - Export revenues enable the purchase of imported capital equipment;
  - Export targets encouraged inward FDI that bring new technologies.

- Is export promotion a good strategy for other regions and countries?
- There are several issues that may limit this strategy:
  - Can the world’s industrial economies absorb the quantity of exports generated?
    - Will there be political repercussions as manufacturing sectors shrink in the high income countries?
  - The Uruguay Round of the WTO limits some export promotion policies.

## Case Study:  Asian Trade Blocs

| Year | Under negotiation | Concluded | Proposed |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1975 |   0 |   1 |   0 |
| 1991 |   0 |   7 |   1 |
| 2000 |   6 |   45 |   3 |
| 2016 | 69 | 151 | 67 |

- The **Association of South-East Nations (ASEAN) **was the only trade association in the 1970s.
  - Initially it was a security and military cooperation agreement, but added an FTA in 1992.
- Many new agreements began in the 1990s and gained momentum in the 2000s after the Asian Crisis of 1997-1998.

## Is There an Asian Model of Economic Growth?

- Free-market economists:
  - Growth was due to openness, private markets, and strong macroeconomic fundamentals.
- Activist economists:
  - All of the above were critical, but other factors helped push growth above what it would have been:
    - Export promotion, industrial policies, deliberation councils.
- Some East Asian politicians argue that limits on civil and political liberties were beneficial.

- Recall that labor productivity is defined as the ratio Q/L, where Q is output and L is labor input.
- Growth accounting breaks this down into the share of the increase in labor productivity that is due to:
  - Increased labor skills;
  - More capital at work;
  - An unexplained factor that is not due to increases in labor skills or capital inputs:  **Total factor productivity (TFP).**
- Labor productivity growth in East Asia is predominantly due to increases in capital.
  - This implies that the causes of growth are the same as in other high income regions of the world.

- The achievement of East Asian economies is not due to a different model of growth, but is remarkable nonetheless.
- East Asian economies were able to create and harness:
  - High savings which were invested in productive activities;
  - A skilled and literate labor force;
  - Strong institutions;
  - Macroeconomic stability.
