Chapter 3: Comparative Advantage and the Gains from Trade

1\. Use the information in the table on labor productivities in France
and Germany to answer questions a through f.

                   **Output per Hour Worked**  

                   **France**                  **Germany**

  Cheese           2 kilograms                 1 kilogram

  Cars             0.25                        0.5

a.  Which country has an absolute advantage in cheese? In cars?

b.  What is the relative price of cheese in France if it does not trade?
    In Germany?

c.  What is opportunity cost of cheese in France? In Germany?

d.  Which country has a comparative advantage in cheese? In cars?
    Explain your answer.

e.  What are the upper and lower bounds for the trade price of cheese?

f\. Draw a hypothetical PPC for France and label its slope. Suppose
that France follows its comparative advantage in deciding where to
produce on its PPC. Label its production point.If the trade price of
cars is 5 kilograms of cheese per car, draw a trade line (CPC) showing
how France can gain from trade.

3\. Explain how a nation can gain from trade even though not everyone is
made better off. Is this a contradiction?

4\. Economic nationalists in developed countries worry that
international trade is destroying the national economy. A common
complaint is that trade agreements open the economy to increased trade
with countries where workers are paid a fraction of what they earn at
home. Explain the faulty logic of this argument.

5\. Many people believe that the goal of international trade should be
to create jobs. Consequently, when they see workers laid off due to a
firm's inability to compete against cheaper and better imports, they
assume that trade must be bad for the economy. Is this assumption
correct? Why, or why not?
