## The Heckscher‐Ohlin Trade Model

- Eli Heckscher and Bertil Ohlin:  20th century Swedish economists. 
  - Best known for their model explaining patterns of international trade.
  - Also called the **factor proportions model**.
- **HO Model idea**:  The relative abundance of different ==factors== of production (inputs) determine which country has a comparative advantage in which goods.
- The HO Model: 2x2x2
  - 2 inputs, called labor and capital
  - 2 outputs, called bread and steel
  - 2 countries, called the U.S. and Canada
- **Relative factor endowments** are ==the ratios of== capital to labor.
  - Written:  K/L

|         | US          | Canada     |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Capital | 50 machines | 2 machines |
| Labor   | 150 workers | 10 workers |

- Factor abundance depends on the ratios of K to L.
  - $K_{CA} / L_{CA} = 2 / 10 = 1/5$
  - $K_{US} / L_{US} = 50 / 150 = 1/3$
- Since $K_{US} / L_{US} > K_{CA} / L_{CA}$  the US is ==capital abundant== compared to Canada and Canada is labor abundant compared to the U.S
- Relative factor abundance determines which goods a country will export and import
  - Relative abundance means the input is relatively less expensive than the other input
  - Relative scarcity`匮乏` means the opposite
  - Capital is relatively cheap in the US, labor is relatively expensive. Vice versa for Canada

> HO Model: Countries will have a comparative ==advantage in== the production of goods that ==intensively use their relatively abundant factor==

- In our model with bread and steel, assume the recipe for steel requires relatively more capital per unit of labor than bread.
  - Steel is capital intensive, bread is labor intensive
  - The U.S. is capital abundant, it will have a comparative advantage in steel
  - Canada is labor abundant, it will have a comparative advantage in bread
- The HO Model predicts that the U.S. exports steel, imports bread
- Unlike the Ricardian Model:  Incomplete specialization
- In the real world: The U.S., compared to other countries, is relatively abundant in:
  - **Capital**
  - Certain **natural resources** such as agricultural land
  - **Skilled labor,** particularly scientific, engineering, and managerial
- According to HO, the U.S. should ==export capital intensive== goods (example:  aircraft); agricultural products (example:  grains); and technology (example: pharmaceuticals).

## The PPC `production possibility curve` with Two Factors

- The Ricardian model of Chapter 3 assumed one homogenous input with a constant tradeoff between the two goods
  - Complete specialization
- The HO Model assumes two inputs and different input requirements for each good
  - Steel takes more capital, less labor
  - Bread takes more labor, less capital
- This produces a PPC that is convex`凸的`
  - The opportunity cost increases when we produce more of one good because we are moving inputs that are less suited to the good with expanding output.
  - Incomplete specialization

## Income Distribution Effects of Trade in the HO Model

- Ricardian Model: Every individual benefits from trade.
  - One input, labor
  - Labor is homogeneous and moves without friction between sectors
- HO Model: **Not** every factor of production benefits
  - Two inputs, labor and capital
  - Owners of labor or capital may be harmed, ==depending on which output shrinks== when trade begins
- Trade moves an economy along its PPC, increasing output of one good, shrinking output of the other
- Income for owners of capital and labor ==**depends on how much demand there is for their services**==.
  - This is called **derived demand**`衍生需求`
- The demand for their services depends on what is produced
  - In the bread and steel example, the US increased output of steel which uses more capital, less labor
  - The incomes of both factors will be affected
- In our example, the price of steel increased in the US, bread fell. The opposite was true in Canada
- The Stolper‐Samuelson Theorem:
  - An **increase** in the price of a good **raises the income** of the **factor used intensively** in its production
  - A **decrease** in the price of a good **lowers the income** of the **factor used intensively** in its production
- - US:  returns on capital increase, wages fall
  - Canada:  returns on capital fall, wages rise

## Income Distribution in the Short Run

- The HO Model as presented describes the long run, after all changes have worked through the economy
  - We assumed workers and capital owners could effortlessly move from bread to steel and back, as needed
  - In the ==short== run, however, they may be stuck
- The Specific Factors Model describes what happens
  - Three factors:  Land, Labor, and Capital
  - Two outputs:  bread and steel
  - One factor is specific to each output: 
    - Bread is made with labor and land
    - Steel is made with labor and capital
- After trade begins:
  - US landowners see a decline in the demand for land, incomes fall.  Owners of the specific factor used intensively in the declining industry are hurt
  - US capital owners see an increase in demand for capital, incomes rise. Owners of the specific factor used intensively in the expanding industry are better off
  - Labor? 
    - Some move from bread to steel, but since steel is not labor intensive, their wages fall (same as HO).
    - However, bread is cheaper, they are better off in that way
    - Steel is more expensive, they are worse off from that
    - Net result is indeterminate

## Case Study:  Comparative Advantage in a Single Natural Resource

![image-20220712092207685](img/image-20220712092207685.png)

- The **resource curse**: The abundant endowment of a single valuable resource can crowd out other economic activities.
  - Labor and capital become concentrated in the production of the resource because it is so valuable. It is so hard to develop alternative industries
  - In countries with weak institutions, fighting over the gains from the resource hinders economic development
- The resource curse is not inevitable:  see Canada

## Empirical Tests of the Theory of Comparative Advantage

- Tests of the Ricardian Model are relatively successful in predicting export patterns.
  - In this model trade is driven by productivity differences
- Tests of the factor endowment (HO) model of trade yield mixed result 
  - Empirical tests are difficult:  How to measure factor endowments?  Prices in autarky?
  - Trade is also affected by technological differences.  We assumed the same technology in the two trading economies but in reality, different countries have different technologies.
  - Other factors are also important: economies of scale, corporate structures, economic policies

## Extensions of the HO Model:  The Product Cycle

The **product cycle** describes ==how production migrates== ==from high income==, advanced economies ==to middle income== developing economies

- **Early stage** of production:  Locate in high income country
  - Need science and engineering skills to develop new product
  - Need high income consumers to try it out, provide feedback
- **Middle stage** of production, location begins to shift
  - Design and production processes beginning to be standardized
  - Mass production beginning.
  - Labor costs begin to matter more.
- **Late stage**:
  - Production moves where labor costs are low.
  - The product is completely standardized

## Case Study: China’s Top 10 Exports to the U.S.

![image-20220712094110504](img/image-20220712094110504.png)

- The product cycle and China’s labor endowment explain many of their top exports to the U.S.
  - Standardized production:  cell phones, computers, telecommunications equipment
  - Labor intensive production:  toys, games, sporting goods, furniture, apparel, footwear.
- Over time, China moves up the ladder of comparative advantage, producing more capital intensive and skilled labor intensive goods

## Extension of the HO Model:  Investing versus Trading

- In the HO Model, countries export one thing, import something different
- In the **product cycle**, firms invest abroad and some output may be sent back home
  - A significant share of imports are **intrafirm trade**: Trade within one firm.  
  - In the mid‐1990s, around 1/3 of U.S. goods exports and 2/5ths of imports were intrafirm
- The **OLI theory** explains why firms choose to invest abroad instead of trading
  - O:  **Ownership** of an asset that makes a firm competitive, e.g., technology, trademark, reputation, etc
  - L:  **Location** abroad offers some advantage, such as proximity to markets, lower production costs, etc.
  - I:  **Internalization** of the advantage instead of subcontracting or selling the right to produce the product
- - **Outsourcing** refers to moving some part of production to another firm, either inside the home country or outside
  - **Off‐shoring** refers to moving some or all of production abroad
    - If a firm off‐shores but does not outsource, it is working with a **foreign affiliate**
    - All combinations of off‐shoring and outsourcing are possible
- Modern telecommunications and transportation make off‐shoring easier today
- This heightens worries about the effects of off‐shoring.
  - The loss of manufacturing jobs.
  - Technology theft (non‐enforcement of patents, etc.)
  - Services might be next:  medical services, accounting, IT, etc., delivered over the internet

## Extension of the HO Model: Internationally Mobile Labor

- The HO Model assumes that workers cannot move across international borders.
- In 2013, there were an estimated 231 million international migrants.
  - 20 percent were in the U.S.
  - Two thirds were in high income countries
- In theory, labor inflows can influence comparative advantage by changing the labor endowment
  - In the U.S. in the 1980s, the inflow of low skilled immigrants from Central America caused growth in California’s apparel sector.
  - U.S. agriculture relies on immigrant workers.
  - Immigrants in some countries work mainly in sectors producing non‐traded goods—construction, nursing, etc.
- Economic analysis of **migration relies on three dominant factors**:
  - **Demand** pull factors:  Pull migrants in (jobs higher wages, promises of a better life, etc.)
  - **Supply** push factors:  Push migrants out of their home country (poverty, wars, persecution, etc.)
  - **Social networks**:  Determine where they settle in the receiving country (where there are family, friends, community members from home).

### Trade, Wages, and Jobs

- The industry and location of jobs (kinds of jobs) may be affected by trade.
  - Moving along a PPC.
  - There may be short run effects on jobs in particular industries.
- The overall number of jobs is not determined by trade; other factors are far more important.
  - Fiscal and monetary policies.
  - Labor market policies
- Manufacturing is the most discussed case.
  - Productivity increases reduce the need for labor.
  - Services and manufactured goods production expand with income, but more and more labor ends up in services because its productivity does not rise as fast as in manufacturing.
- Much more manufacturing production today is exposed to international competition.
  - Growth of China and other emerging economies.
  - Transportation and telecommunications revolutions

Q:  Does trade with emerging markets cause wages to fall in high income economies?

A:  Economists are not certain

- Trade may play some role in wage stagnation in advanced economies.
- But it is also possible that it has little or no effect.
- Many possibilities:  For example, automation reduced the need for labor in manufacturing.
- We need more research on this topic

Suppose trade causes jobs to be lost at home, wages to fall.  What should we do?

Options: 

- Stop trading and block off‐shoring;
- Selectively block imports and off‐shoring;
- Keep trading and investing but assist workers.
- Do nothing.

Each option has costs and benefits

# Tutorial

1. According to the following table, which country is relatively more labor-abundant? Explain your answer. Which is relatively more capital-abundant?
    |         | **United States** | **Canada**  |
    | ------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
    | Capital | 40 machines       | 10 machines |
    | Labor   | 200 workers       | 60 workers  |

    **Answer:**  
    
    - The capital-labor ratios are 1/5 and 1/6 for the United States and Canada. Since 1/5 is greater than 1/6, the United States is capital abundant. By the same reasoning, the labor-capital ratio is higher in Canada, so it is labor abundant.

---

2. Suppose that the United States and Canada have the factor endowments given in the table in Question 1. Suppose further that the production requirements for a unit of steel is 2 machines and 8 workers, and the requirement for a unit of bread is 1 machine and 8 workers.

   1. Which good, bread or steel, is relatively capital-intensive? Labor-intensive? Explain your answer.
   2. Which country would export bread? Why?

   **Answers:** 

   1. The capital-labor ratio to make steel is 1/4; to make bread it is 1/8. Hence steel is more capital intensive and bread is more labor intensive.
   2. Since the United States is capital abundant and steel is capital intensive, according to the Heckscher-Ohlin trade model, the United States will export steel and Canada will export bread.

---

5. Suppose that there are three factors: capital, labor, and land. Bread requires inputs of land and labor, and steel requires capital and labor.

   1. Which factors are variable, and which are specific?
   2. Suppose Canada’s endowments of land and capital are 10 capital and 100 land, and the United States’ are 50 capital and 100 land. Which good does each country export?
   3. How does trade affect the returns to land, labor, and capital in the United States and in Canada?

   **Answers:**

   1. Labor is the variable factor and capital and land are specific.
   2. Canada is land abundant relative to the United States (100/10 is greater than 100/50), so Canada’s comparative advantage is in the export of bread, the good with the specific input of land. The United States’ comparative advantage is steel.
   3. In the United States, owners of land are hurt by trade, owners of capital benefit, and the effects on labor are indeterminate. The latter effect depends on labor’s preference for bread and steel. In the United States, bread prices fall, but steel prices rise. In Canada, owners of land benefit from trade, owners of capital are hurt, and the effects on labor are indeterminate. The latter effect depends on labor’s preference for bread and steel. In Canada, bread prices rise, but steel prices fall.

6. Describe the changes in production requirements and the location of production that take place over the three phases of the product cycle.

   **Answer:**  

   - **In the first phase, all production is in high-income countries.** The input requirements include relatively large amounts of scientific and engineering skills, marketing expertise, and access to risk capital. Experimentation with new products depends on access to high-income consumers, and competitive pressures require a quick feedback from consumers to producers. The new products tend to be highly variable in their design and performance characteristics, and experimentation is important in finding the right combination of prices, options, and quality.
   - **In the second phase, some standardization is taking place, along with some sales of the product in developing countries.** The early period of intense experimentation is over and firms are beginning to settle on the lowest-cost production technologies. Production is migrating overseas, where labor costs are lower.
   - **In the final phase, experimentation with design and manufacturing technologies is over, the product is completely standardized, and the input requirements are more heavily biased towards unskilled or semi-skilled labor.** Much of the production can be accomplished in assembly operations, which can be located in low-wage countries. By the third phase, most of the production has left the high-income countries except in the cases where product differentiation can continue.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 \7.  Does intrafirm trade contradict the theory of comparative advantage? Why or why not?

**Answer:**  No, in general, it does not, but it may in some cases. Most intrafirm trade can be understood as a firm that cuts up its production process into several distinct stages, 
 and then relocates some or all of the stages to different countries where the factor endowments are consistent with the production requirements of each stage. Labor-intensive production stages will be relocated to labor-abundant countries, and so forth. 
 In this case, firms are taking advantage of the comparative advantage of different nations in order to produce their goods at the lowest overall cost.

In some cases, however, there may be other motives for locating a production stage in another country. These motives include the desire to avoid trade barriers by producing all or part of a good inside the country where sales are anticipated, the desire to escape taxation, the attempt to deter market entry by a rival firm, and as insurance against unforeseen events (e.g., political instability).

 \9.  Many domestically owned apparel manufacturers buy their garments overseas, sew their labels into them, and then sell them abroad or back into the home market. What are some of the considerations that a clothing manufacturer might go through to choose this strategy instead of producing at home and exporting?

**Answer:**  These firms perceive their asset to be their brand. This may involve some elements of design (ordering specific output from foreign suppliers) but also could involve quality. It can be based strictly on marketing and advertising, creating an image from something that is in the end relatively cheap and easy to create. Allowing foreign firms the ability to brand the clothes through licensing makes, them lose control of this asset. Sewing labels in allows some element of quality control while reducing production costs. Garment assembly is relatively labor intense and low skill, making it more likely to occur in less-developed, labor-abundant countries. Design, marketing, and access to high-spending consumers are more likely to be assets of firms in developed countries. Owning an assembly operation directly is not necessary for them to preserve this asset as long as they have ultimate control over what they put their name on and how that product is distributed and marketed.

\10.  Suppose Spain were to open its doors to a large number of unskilled Africans seeking to immigrate. In general, what effects would you expect to see in Spain’s trade patterns and its comparative advantage?

**Answer:**  In theory, labor becomes more abundant and Spain’s comparative advantage could shift to unskilled, labor-intense production. In practice, this labor inflow may be used to produce services that are not traded. They may free up citizens to work in the already existing export sector and have little effect on comparative advantage.
