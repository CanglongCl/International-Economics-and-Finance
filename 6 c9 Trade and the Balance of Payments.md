# Chapter 9 Trade and the Balance of Payments

## Learning Objectives

- **9.1** Define the current, capital, and financial accounts of a country’s balance of payments. 
- **9.2** Explain the importance of the three main components of the current account. 
- **9.3** Describe three types of international capital flows. 
- **9.4** Use a simple algebraic model to relate the current account to savings, investment and the general government budget balance. 
- **9.5** Discuss the pros and cons of current account deficits. 
- **9.6** Show the relationship between a country’s balance of payments and its international investment position.

## The Current Account


- There are three accounts within the balance of payments. 
  1. The **current account** primarily tracks the flow of goods and services between a country and the rest of the world world. 
  2. The **capital account** is the smallest of the three accounts and records transfers of specialized capital assets between countries. 
  3. The **financial account** is the record of all financial transactions between a country and the rest of the world. 
- The **current account balance** has three separate components: 
  1. The **trade balance** is the largest component and is the record of exports and imports of goods and is the record of exports and imports of goods and services; 
  2. Income received from abroad minus income paid abroad, called **primary income**; 
  3. Transfers made abroad minus transfers received from abroad, called **secondary income**. 

## The Current Account and the Macroeconomy

Since

- GNP = GDP + net primary income + net secondary income; or 
- GNP = C + I + G + X – M + net primary income + net secondary income; or 
- GNP = C + I + G + CA.

We can also define: GNP = C + S + T; 

- This looks at GNP from the perspective of income recipients: They can consume, save, and pay taxes. 

Setting the two definitions of GNP equal to each other: 

- C + I + G + CA = C + S + T; or 
- S + (T – G) = I + CA. 

The accounting identity S + (T – G) = I + CA, says: 

- Private savings + public savings = domestic investment + foreign investment. 

This shows the relationship between: 

- Budget deficits and trade (current account) deficits
- Overall savings and investment in an open economy that trades;
- Foreign and domestic investment; 
- Private and public savings. 

## Are Current Account Deficits harmful?


- But they can sometimes be a sign of economic strength: 
  - If they are caused by large inflows of foreign capital, looking for a place to invest; 
  - If they are caused by a rise in imports when an economy experiences rapid economic growth. 
- There is no exact threshold for when a deficit becomes dangerous, but for most countries, when they reach 3‐5% of GDP, it is in the danger zone.

## International Debt


- Net capital inflows are an increase in liabilities to foreign nations.  
  - The inflows can take several forms: FDI, portfolio investment, bank loans and others. 
  - Some forms represent an increase in debt by the home country to foreigners. 
    - **External debt** creates **debt service** obligations. 
- The burden of external debt depends on a number of factors. 
  - Its size relative to GDP; 
  - Whether denominated in home or foreign country currency; 
  - The size of the current account deficit and the need for continued capital inflows. 
- Debt can become unsustainable when: 
  - Debt service increases faster than GDP; 
  - Debt is denominated in a foreign currency and the borrowing country has a significant decline in the value of its own currency; 
  - A borrowing country depends on exports of 1 or 2 commodities that g y p p have falling prices in the world market. 
- The Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) is a World Bank program to offer debt relief to the most indebted, poorest countries.
