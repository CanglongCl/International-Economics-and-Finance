12.5 Describe the main forces behind the global  financial crisis that began in 2007.

## The Challenge of Financial Integration


- Economic integration has benefits but also risks. 
  - Financial crises spread more easily from one country to another when economic linkages are present.
    - There are many recent examples: The European currency crisis in 1992; the Mexican peso crisis of 1994-95 that spread to South America; the Asian Crisis of 1997-1998; the recent global financial crisis, and others. 
- Financial crises are worth studying: they cause governments to collapse, they bankrupt businesses, and they ruin lives.

## Definition of Financial Crises


- Economists have identified 3 main types of crises: 
  - Banking crisis; 
  - Currency crisis; 
  - Debt crisis. 
- Each has its own set of characteristics.

### Banking crises:

- A crisis occurs when the banking system—or a significant number of banks--cannot perform its main functions and requires assistance. 
- Banks engage in **intermediation** between borrowers and savers; in a crisis there is **disintermediation.** 
- Households and businesses lose access to credit; consumption and investment decline.

### Currency crises: 

- Also called an **exchange rate crisis.** 
- A sudden large depreciation in the exchange rate. 

Currency crises have several negative effects. 
- Debt denominated in a foreign currency increases in real value. 
- A loss of confidence in the economy and the currency can cause further selling and a continued currency collapse. 
- A loss of outside financing and an immediate need to eliminate current account deficits.

### Debt crises: 

- May be private debt or public; 
  - A **sovereign default** is government that cannot pay its debt. 
- May be external or internal; 
  - External debt is debt owed in a foreign currency and subject to rules set in a foreign jurisdiction. 
  - Internal debt is owed in the domestic currency and is under domestic jurisdiction. 
- Debt crisis usually leads to restructuring of the debt rather than complete repudiation. 
  - The debt maturity may be lengthened; 
  - Interest rate may be lowered; 
  - Partial debt forgiveness is common.

## Vulnerabilities`漏洞`, Triggers`导火索`, and Contagion`传播`

### Crisis vulnerabilities

- Economic conditions that make a country vulnerable to a crisis. 
- Two kinds are considered here: 
  - Macroeconomic imbalances. 
  - Volatile capital flows. 

#### Vulnerability: Economic imbalances. 

- These take multiple forms. 
  - Unsustainable government deficits; 
  - Large private debt levels; 
  - Large current account deficits; 
  - Overvalued currencies. 
- The global crisis of 2007 had several of these, including excessive private debt and large current account deficits.

#### Vulnerability: Volatile capital flows. 

- Financial capital can nearly ==instantaneously shift from one market to another==, putting pressure on exchange rates, current accounts, and private and government borrowing. 
  - The Asian Crisis of 1997-1998 is an example (see below). 

- ==Weak supervision and regulatory== oversight can complicate this problem. 
  - For example, banks with a lot of short term international loans. 
- When financial capital starts to move out of a country, it can become a stampede`踩踏` that leads to a crisis, or it may be limited if foreigners have confidence in the borrowing economy. 
  - Multiple equilibria are possible, no way to determine whether a crisis will develop, or if conditions will return to normal.

### Crisis triggers

- Events that trigger a crisis. 
- These are unpredictable and without the vulnerabilities, would often not trigger a crisis.

### Contagion

Most crises remain purely domestic, but some do spillover into other economies.

Sources of contagion: 
- ==Direct linkages==; for example, banks and other economic interests purchased assets tied to the U.S. housing market before the recent financial crisis. `外国的问题资产`
- ==“Wake up calls”==: When one country experiences problems, it signals that **similar countries may have similar problems**. 
- ==Common economic fundamentals==: The **factors** affecting one country has a **similar negative impact** elsewhere because the economies share similar characteristics.

### Case Study: The Mexican Peso Crisis of 1994-95


- Both economic imbalances and volatile capital flows were involved. 
- Imbalances: 
  - Overvalued exchange rate; 
  - Low savings rates relative to investment led to large current account deficits. 
- Capital flows: 
  - Were actively encouraged by government policy as a way to obtain investment funds; 
  - The signing of NAFTA encouraged foreigners to invest in Mexico.
- Triggers: 
  - Rising interest rates in the U.S. increased the cost of Mexican borrowing. 
  - Political events in Mexico caused nervous investors to reassess their exposure to the Mexican market; 
    - Two political assassinations, a regional uprising in Southern Mexico (the Zapatista movement). 

>
> - December, 1995, newly elected President Zedillo devalues the peso, but not by enough and more capital leaves the country. 
> - Two days later, he switches the currency to a floating exchange rate from one that was pegged to the dollar. 
>   - The currency collapses, losing more than 50 percent of its value over the next 4 months.
> - In the short run, loans and lines of credit from the US, Canada, and the IMF help calm the outflow of capital. 
> - To address longer term problems, Mexico implemented expenditure switching and expenditure reducing policies. 
>   - Devaluation followed by a switch to a floating exchange rate. 
>   - Contractionary fiscal policy, i.e., austerity. 
> - GDP fell over 6 percent, and unemployment rose dramatically.

## Domestic Issues in Crisis Avoidance

Some policies to avoid crises are straightforward and easy to understand, if not always easy to follow: 
- Credible and sustainable monetary and fiscal policies, including sustainable levels of government debt; 
- Avoidance of overvalued exchange rates; 
- Active supervision and regulation of the financial system; 
- Provision of timely information of interest to international investors, such as reserve holdings of the central bank. 

### Moral hazard problems

- During a crisis, there is a large incentive to keep credit flowing and avoid a collapse in the banking system; 
- Bailouts`救助` may encourage firms to take excessive risks and increase the probability of future crises; 
- But failure to bailout failing financial firms may increase the severity of the crisis by making it deeper and wider.

Moral hazard problems and **capital requirements**: 
- Economists agree that banks should have more capital as the source of their operating funds. 
- Banks mostly use borrowed money; capital is the money of shareholders and bank owners and is an alternative to borrowing operating funds. 

The **Basel Accords**`巴塞尔协议` are an international agreement among the world’s main central banks to increase capital requirements. 

- Most of the world’s advanced economies have increased bank capital requirements since the global financial crisis. 


- Economists are not in agreement about the theoretical optimum for capital requirements.

### Exchange rate policy

Exchange rates must be credible and sustainable. 

- Countries must avoid real appreciation due to inflation. 
- A number of crises have been caused when countries adopted crawling peg exchange rate systems as a mechanism to combat inflation. 
- Recall that $R_r = R_n(P^*/P)$; if a country fixes its exchange rate, then periodically devalues $R_n$ to compensate for higher inflation at home, $R_r$ does not change. 
- If $\Delta R_n$ is less than the difference in inflation rates, then $R_r$ appreciates.

### Capital controls

Capital controls: restrictions on the movement of capital into and/or out of a country. 


- Economists are divided on this issue: 
  - Con: Capital controls are sometimes easily avoidable, and therefore ineffective; they limit capital for investment that increases growth. 
  - Pro: Capital controls can help avoid a sudden exit of capital; financial crises are more costly to growth than the benefits of free-flowing capital. 
- Restrictions on capital inflows are more effective than restrictions on outflows.

### Case Study: The Asian Crisis of 1997- 1998


- The crisis began in Thailand in July, 1997. 
  - Soon spread to other Asian economies, including Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. 
- Vulnerabilities: 
  - Large current account deficits; 
    - High growth rates for long periods enabled these countries to borrow easily to finance current account deficits. 
  - Overvalued exchange rates; 
    - Many pegged to the U.S. dollar; as the dollar appreciated, so did they. 
  - Weak oversight supervision of banking and finance; 
    - Maturity mismatches, politically motivated lending, and excessive borrowing from abroad.

- Triggers: 
  - Falling values for the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen made Thailand’s baht overvalued. 
  - A fall in computer chip prices hurt one of Thailand’s main export industries. 
  - Investors lost faith that Thailand could remain pegged to the dollar. 
- Contagion: Uncertain why it spread so rapidly. 
  - Possibly a “wake up call” for investors to look at other countries.

- Consequences of the crisis: 
  - Currency collapses throughout the region as investors pulled out their money. 
  - Bankruptcies increase, economic activity turns down and recessions take hold. 
  - China and other emerging markets embark on campaigns to build up their reserves though export surpluses. 
- Three debates: 
  - Did the IMF give bad advice to defend currencies instead of avoiding recession? 
  - To what extent was moral hazard a problem? 
  - Can capital controls stop capital flight once it begins?

## **Domestic Policies for Crisis** Management


- Crisis problems are often intractable since any possible response may solve one problem but make something else worse. 
  - Example, the Asian Crisis 
    - The IMF pushed countries to raise interest rates to try to defend their currencies. This deepened the recessions brought on by the crisis. 
    - The alternative was to fight the recession and let the currency fall; but a lot of debt was denominated in foreign currencies, and this would have increased bankruptcies.
- Crises caused by government debt or other imbalances seem to have easy to understand but painful to implement solutions: 
  - Cut spending, raise taxes. 
- But political obstacles or humanitarian concerns may make this difficult: 
  - Spending cuts hit vulnerable populations; 
  - Divided governments may not be able to implement recommended policies due to a lack of consensus. 
- In general, crises with an international dimension—foreign debts, capital flight, exchange rate overvaluation—are more difficult to resolve.

## Reform of the International Financial Architecture


- The increased frequency of crises since the end of Bretton Woods has led to a search for new systems and rules for financial management that would reduce the frequency and severity of crises. 
- There are a wide variety of proposals, many of them at odds with each other. 
- Two issues stand out: 
  - The need for and policies governing a lender of last resort; 
  - The conditions a lender should impose on borrowing countries.

- Should there be an **international lender of last resort**? 
  - Con: It increases moral hazard; supports excessive risk taking, particularly as failing firms engage in riskier activities to try to avoid collapse. 
  - Pro: It avoids the worse meltdowns; financial regulation can reduce moral hazard problems. 
- How much should countries be allowed to borrow? 
  - Current limits are 300% of quota, but often exceeded. 
  - The IMF cannot support a moderately large economy as it lacks the resources necessary.

- What conditions should be imposed on borrowers? 
  - Called **conditionality**; the IMF disburses loans in **tranches**, or “slices,” as borrowing countries make required reforms. 
- Questions: 
  - Should the conditions address only immediate problems, such as fixing a current account deficit? 
  - Or, should they address deeper problems that are obstacles to greater efficiency and competitiveness, such as requiring the privatization of heavily subsidized state owned firms? 
  - And what if there is not a consensus about the best policies?

- Three more issues: 
  - **Standstills.** 
    - Should the IMF be able to call for a temporary stop to interest and principal payments to international lenders by countries in crisis? 
  - **Data dissemination.** `数据共享`
    - There is widespread agreement that timely reporting of financial and economic data can help ameliorate or possible even avoid some crises. 
  - **Collective action clauses.** `一致行动`
    - International lenders must agree to collective mediation at the time they make loans.

## Case Study: The Global Financial Crisis of 2007


- The crisis began in 2007, intensified in 2008, and gradually came to an end in 2009. 
- Vulnerability 1: Current account imbalances: 
  - Large current account deficits in the U.S., U.K., Spain, Greece, and some other nations. 
  - These were matched by large current account surpluses in China, Japan, Germany, and several oil exporters. 
- Vulnerability 2: Weak financial oversight. 
  - Financial innovation created new financial instruments with poorly understood risks. 
  - New types of firms entered financial markets with **securitized** debts and other new products


- Triggers: 
  - Uncertain what the exact trigger was. 
  - Nevertheless, the decline in housing prices in the U.S. set off a wave of defaults on home loans that undermined the value of securitized mortgages. 
- Contagion: 
  - The crisis easily spread from the United States as European and other financial entities had purchased the securitized mortgages issued by U.S. financial firms.
